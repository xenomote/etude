# Etude

A programming language project for testing experimental language features

## What is this project for

This project is intended for experimenting with novel language features:

- documentation tooling and change management
- syntactically significant statement grouping
- automated source code rearrangement
- structs, arrays and sets as composition types
- arbitrary byte-width integers or floats
- structural function typing and type inference
- automatic asynchronicity and concurrency management
- forbidding any global state and ringfencing hardware interaction
- compiler assisted logging as a language feature
- compiler assisted error handling as a language feature
- dedicated languages with separate file types for specific concerns

## How to run

1. [install latest golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. `go run github.com/xenomote/etude`
