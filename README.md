# Etude

A programming language project for testing experimental language features

## What is this project for

This project is intended for experimenting with novel language features:

- arbitrary byte-width integers or floats
- structs, arrays and sets as composition types
- forbidding any global state and ringfencing hardware interaction
- dedicated languages with separate file types for specific concerns
- compiler assisted error handling
- compiler assisted logging
- compiler assisted documentation
- structural function typing
- automatic type inference
- automatic asynchronicity and concurrency management
- syntactically significant statement grouping
- automated source code rearrangement
- uniform access to functions through the command line as mini-executables

## How to run

1. [install latest golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. `go run github.com/xenomote/etude`
